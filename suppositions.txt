The maximum "payment" in a game with n participants is: SUM{i^2}, i from 1 to n-1 (#1)
Why?
Let`s try to change this situation (increasing the final payment):
Assume that A won the match with B.
Assume that x as the score of the player A and k the score of other player B.
In this case x > k (otherwise we can't have (#1) as the final payment).
The payment for them is x^2 + k^2 (#2).
Now let`s change the the result of their match.
Then the payment is equal (x-1)^2 + (k+1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + k^2 +2k + 1 (#3)
How much did we increase in the payment? (#3) - (#2)
(x^2 - 2x + 1 + k^2 +2k + 1) - (x^2 + k^2) = 2(-x + k + 1).
Now we can see that:
1) If x > k, then we decreased the payment
2) else if x = k, then we increased the payment by 1
3) else we increased the payment.
As we assumed x > k, then we decreased the total payment, so there is no final payment greater than (#1).
In other words we need concentrate the winnings as much as we can to get the highest payment.

In the same way we can discover that the lowest payment occurs at the most distributed winnings, i.e,

When n%2=0: SUM{(n/2)^2+((n-2)/2)^}, i from 1 to n/2
When n%2=1: SUM{((n-1)/2)^2}, i from 1 to n
