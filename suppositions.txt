The maximum "payment" in a game with n participants is: SUM{i^2}, i from 1 to n-1 (#1)
Why? Let's see what happen when we change the result of one match:
Assume that A won the match with B.
Assume x as the score of the player A and k the score of other player B.
The payment for them is x^2 + k^2 (#2).
Now let`s change the the result of their match.
Then the payment is equal (x-1)^2 + (k+1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + k^2 +2k + 1 (#3)
How much did we increase in the payment? (#3) - (#2)
(x^2 - 2x + 1 + k^2 +2k + 1) - (x^2 + k^2) = 2(-x + k + 1).
Now we can see that:
1) x > k+1 -> we decreased the payment
2) x = k+1 -> the payment won't change.
3) x <= k -> we increased the payment

Let`s try to change this situation #1 (increasing the final payment):
Take a player C who won D. Let A's score equals y and B's score equals z.
In the structure to have #1 if C won D, y > z (otherwise we can't have (#1) as the final payment).
If we change the match result, as we proofed, the final payment will decrease or not change because y > z.
(Actually, in that case, if y = z+1, when we change their match result we don't change the structure).
This proofs that with one change it's not possible increase the payment.
It's clear that we can't increase the final payment with more changes
(because of the changes to increase the payment will "undone" a previous change).
In other words we need concentrate the winnings as much as we can to get the highest payment (what occurs in (#1)).

In the same way we can discover that the lowest payment occurs at the most distributed winnings, i.e,

When n%2=0: SUM{(n/2)^2+((n-2)/2)^2}, i from 1 to n/2
When n%2=1: SUM{((n-1)/2)^2}, i from 1 to n
